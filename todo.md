MVP:

-
-
- MUST HAVE:

manually select what shows up on home page using a star system or something like that to assign priority

tabs: today, all, backlog, unassigned, archived, deleted

manually reassign goals to parent goals

use database

have a today page

show a red alert if more than 4 items are in today (make me update and move around)

make backlog tab where everything shows up (grouped by parent goal)

have fuzzy search

be able to check off tasks

be able to hide (archive tasks only when completed) - do not allow archive of parent goals when child goals exist

be able to delete (deleted at only when not completed) - do not allow delete of parent goals when child goals exist

allow reassignment of parent and child goals

force editing deadline/parent goal, mark as complete, or delete when past due

-
-
- SHOULD HAVE:

click into goal to see more

external linking

error when trying to set a parent goal to itself
error when trying to set a child goal to have more than 1 parent
allow child goal to be parentless

history of changes
